    <h1>About Pipeliner</h1>
   <a href="./index.html" target="_parent">(Return to Main Page)</a>

		<br>Pipeliner provides access to some of the NGS data analysis pipelines used by CCBR on the NIH Biowulf Linux Cluster. Pipeliner allows the user to select a set of data files, such as fastq sequence reads, and process them via a sequence of programs that constitute an analysis 'pipeline' to reach an endpoint, such as a list of mutations with accompanying annotations. The program provides a graphical interface in which pipeline options are configured using pulldowns and text entry fields. Once configured, the pipeline is executed on the Biowulf cluster.
